# complex-plotting
Some python code for visualizing complex functions (from ℂ to ℂ) using domain coloring and contour lines.

This displays an intereactive 3D plot including a section of the complex plane and the Rieman (Stereographic) Sphere (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere). The view can be panned, rotated, & zoomed—and the sphere or plane can be hidden—within the interactive GUI, but setting the function to be plotted, the resolution, the nature of the contours, and so forth must be done by altering the code before execution. See the code for details. 

As an amateur Pythoneer, much credit and thanks is due to the authors of the example code I stitched together to make this:
